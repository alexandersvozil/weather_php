Looks like it's a cool and clear night in Luxembourg! Time to break out the hot cocoa and snuggle up with a good book. 🌙☕️ Don't forget to check the wind direction - it might be perfect for flying a kite... or a witch's broomstick! 🧹 Either way, it's a perfect evening to enjoy the peaceful night sky. 🌟
