Looks like it's a beautiful, sunny day in Luxembourg! 🌞 Time to break out the sunscreen and get those shades on, my friend. With temperatures reaching a toasty 82.6°F (28.1°C), you might just need to start sweating glitter! 💎 But don't worry, the gentle breeze of 13.6 mph (22 kph) will keep you feeling cool and breezy. 🌬️ Just don't forget to hydrate and maybe pack a handheld fan in case you need to beat the heat. 🥤 Enjoy the sunshine, Luxembourg! 😎
